## Introduction

Each summer BC experiences raging wildfire activity across the province, destroying everything in its path such as wildlife habitats and residential communities. Damage such as altered drainage systems, unstabilized exposed soils, and destroyed infrastructure posed to these communities is detrimental and can last for years before full recovery is achieved (BC Wildfire Service, 2023). Furthermore, due to wildfire resulting in ground instability, post-fire hazards such as soil erosion, floods, landslides, and avalanches become an increasing concern (BC Wildfire Service, 2023). A clear correlation can be made between the rising temperatures experienced from May to September and increased wildfire frequency and size in BC, suggesting wildfires may be a direct concequence of the climate, in particular temperature values. 

The objective of this tutorial is to provide visuals to aid in the understanding of spatial variability in the median total income and percentage of residents with french language knowledge in Halifax, Nova Scotia. To conduct the following research, spatial autocorrelation (SAC) techniques will be conducted. Spatial autocorrelation is a measure of the correlation of the provided data (in this case income and french language knowledge) with itself across space, calculated using Morans I. The output is either a positive or negative SAC. Positive SAC tell us that samples at nearby locations have similar data values that are not independent from one another (Dormann et al., 2007). Such results are visually interpreted as being clustered (Griffith, 2017). Negative SAC is when the values close by are dissimilar (Dormann et al., 2007). These results are viewed as dispersed (Griffith, 2017).
