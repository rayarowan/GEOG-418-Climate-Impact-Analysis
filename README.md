## Introduction

The objective of this tutorial is to provide visuals to aid in the understanding of spatial variability in the median total income and percentage of residents with french language knowledge in Halifax, Nova Scotia. To conduct the following research, spatial autocorrelation (SAC) techniques will be conducted. Spatial autocorrelation is a measure of the correlation of the provided data (in this case income and french language knowledge) with itself across space, calculated using Morans I. The output is either a positive or negative SAC. Positive SAC tell us that samples at nearby locations have similar data values that are not independent from one another (Dormann et al., 2007). Such results are visually interpreted as being clustered (Griffith, 2017). Negative SAC is when the values close by are dissimilar (Dormann et al., 2007). These results are viewed as dispersed (Griffith, 2017).
